<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This test suite is based on the following OGC specification:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Web Map Server Implementation Specification</em>, version 1.3.0 <a href="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=14416">[OGC 06-042]</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>What is tested</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>All implementations</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Dataset independent GetCapabilities, GetMap, and GetFeatureInfo requests, as derived from the capabilities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Basic conformance class</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Adds dataset specific GetMap requests.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Transaction conformance class</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Adds dataset specific GetFeatureInfo requests.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What is not tested</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The TIME and ELEVATION dimensions or any custom dimensions.</li>
</ul>
</body>

<h2><a name="requirements">Test requirements</a></h2>
<p>
  To ensure all of the tests in the test suite produce correct results, WMS implementations must meet the following requirements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>All implementations</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>If there are any Dimensions advertised in the capabilities, they must have default values.</li>
  </ul>
  <p/>
  <li><strong>Basic conformance class</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Must support image/png or image/gif for GetMap requests.</li>
    <li>Must contain the test dataset in layers that are subsetable and resizable and support CRS:84.</li>
    <li>The CRS:84 support must be precise up to the ten-thousandth of a degree.</li>
    <li>The default style for the cite:Lakes layer must fill in the polygon with non-white pixels.</li>
    <li>Servers that don't advertise a maximum image size must be able to generate maps as large as 1024x768.  All servers must be able to generate maps as small as 8x5.</li>
  </ul>
  <p/>
  <li><strong>Queryable conformance class</strong></li>
  <p>All for all of the Basic conformance class requirements, plus:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>GetFeatureInfo requests must be supported.</li>
    <li>The cite:BasicPolygons layer must be queryable.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

  <img src="images/warning.gif"/>Warning:
  There are currently slight differences between the schema listed in Annex E.1 and the on-line version Annex E.1 refers to.
  This test suite uses the on-line version.

<h2><a name="dataset">Test Dataset Description</a></h2>
    <p>
      The test dataset for the WMS 1.3.0 test suite is the same as the test dataset for the WMS 1.1.1 test suite.
    </p>

      <a href="../../../data/data-wms-1.3.0.zip">Download the test dataset</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of the dataset is based on the
      <a href="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=7587&version=2">
        Conformance Test Guidelines for OpenGIS Simple Features Specification for SQL, Revision 1.0
      </a>.  This set of features makes up a map of a fictional location called Blue Lake.
      The features are as described in the Simple Features Specification for SQL document,
      except they have been converted to WGS84 coordinates and have been reoriented so the
      area is centered at 0 degrees latitude, 0 degrees longitude.
      Figure 1 shows an overview map of the area with the prominent features labeled.
      Figure 2 shows the location of each of the data points.<br/>
      <br/>
      <table>
        <caption align="bottom">Figure 1:  Overview of Blue Lake vicinity features</caption>
        <tr><td><img src="images/bluelake_features.gif"/></td></tr>

        <tr><td><img src="images/bluelake_coordinates.gif"/></td></tr>
      </table>
      <br/>
      Additional features have also been defined to test data at a larger scale.
      These consist of a diamond and two overlapping squares, as shown in figure 3.
      It does not matter which square appears on top.<br/>

      </table>
      <br/>
      The features are organized into layers as shown in table below.  The layers may be named
      in any fashion, but must be titled exactly as shown in the table.<br/>
